Automatic Number Plate Detection
This project demonstrates how to detect and extract text from vehicle number plates using Python libraries in a Google Colab environment. <br> The project utilizes various image processing techniques, such as grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contouring, to isolate the number plate and extract its text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).<br> Libraries Used for this project are 
EasyOCR: For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from plates.
OpenCV (cv2): For image processing and plate detection.
Imutils: For image manipulation and resizing.
Matplotlib: For visualizing processed images.
NumPy: For numerical and matrix operations.
