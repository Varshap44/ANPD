# ANPD
Automatic Number Plate Detection<br>
This project demonstrates how to detect and extract text from vehicle number plates using Python libraries in a Google Colab environment. <br> The project utilizes various image processing techniques, such as grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contouring, to isolate the number plate and extract its text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).<br> Libraries Used for this project are <br>
EasyOCR: For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from plates.<br>
OpenCV (cv2): For image processing and plate detection.<br>
Imutils: For image manipulation and resizing.<br>
Matplotlib: For visualizing processed images.<br>
NumPy: For numerical and matrix operations.<br>
